# IS452_Final-Project_2017
This repository will house every aspect of my final project for IS452 Foundations of Info Processing (Python).

Please access the website I created for the web scrapping aspect of my final project here: http://is452.lisamwatkins.com/

This folder also includes the .txt file I created that lists out all of the awards, winners, and nominees. 
In addition, you can access the .py file that I will be doing the bulk of my processing in.
